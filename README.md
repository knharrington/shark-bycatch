## About
This repository hosts the public-facing Shark Bycatch Shiny app developed by the [Center for Fisheries Electronic Monitoring at Mote Marine Laboratory](https://mote.org/cfemm). The app is designed to provide insights into shark bycatch data in the commercial bottom longline Gulf of Mexico reef fish fishery through interactive visualizations and tables.

## Features
**Gridded Catch Per Unit Effort Map:** Visualize catch per unit effort (CPUE) values on an interactive map. Darker colors of grid cells denote higher CPUEs. Click on grid cells for more information.

**Effort Figures:** View graphical representations of fishing effort over time as well as temporal trends in CPUE.

**Catch Composition Tables:** Examine detailed tables showing the composition of the shark species caught.
